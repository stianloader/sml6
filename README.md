# SML6

While the SLL ecosystem is focused on transforming the game through
runtime bytecode patches, the SML toolchain is focused on ahead of
time recompilation of galimulator.

At this point, SML6 is technically game agnostic (provided it has),
and has little focus on the decompilation and recompilation aspect
it should have at a later point in time. Instead, the focus is
initially set on the lengthy process of generating mapping files.

SML6 uses gslStarplane's Autodeobf configuration, meaning that it
is also creating spStarmap-compatible mapping files.

## Tasks

SML6 provides the following tasks:
- org.stianloader.sml6.DeobfuscateGameTask
- org.stianloader.sml6.FetchGameTask

Unlike gslStarplane, all tasks should be compatible with gradle's
configuration cache by default.

## Task configuration

### DeobfuscateGameTask

The DeobfuscateGameTask task defines following properties:
- `autoDeobfVersion`: `Property<String>`, controlls the version of Autodeobf (only `"5.0.2"` supported at this point)
- `withAutodeobf`: `Property<Boolean>`, controlls whether to run Autodeobf
- `withSLDeobf`: `Property<Boolean>`, controlls whether to run slDeobf/oaktree
- `withSLDeobfMappings`: `Property<Boolean>`, controlls whether to generate slIntermediary mappings
- `outputDirectory`: `DirectoryProperty`, output files will be stored there by default
- `outputJar`: `RegularFileProperty`, the deobfuscated jar will be stored there
- `inputJar` (**mandatory**): `RegularFileProperty`, the obfuscated input jar
- `slIntermediaryMappings`: `RegularFileProperty`, output file for the slIntermediary mappings generated by sl-deobf. Uses the tinyv1 format.
- `spStarmapMappings`: `RegularFileProperty`, output file for the spStarmap mappings generated by Autodeobf. Uses the tinvyv1 format.

Unless otherwise specified, conventions exist that use sensible default
values. For non-galimulator games, you may want to change
`withAutodeobf`, `withSLDeobf`, and `withSLDeobfMappings`,
though honestly only `withAutodeobf` is really mandatory.
Keep in mind that SML6 expects games to always be a monojar,
an assumption that really does not make much sense. You are welcome
to change it (provided you ensure that it actually does what you want,
I can fix my end later :p).

Note: Although this goes against common sense, the Switchmap
classes get remapped via sl-deobf, but no mappings
file will be generated. So … just don't touch them. This issue
will be resolved eventually, but requires patches to sl-deobf.

### FetchGameTask

The FetchGameTask task defines following properties:
- `aggressiveCaching`: `Property<Boolean>`, whether to cache aggressively. This may easily result in outdated jars for games that update frequently, at the benefit of much better performance.
- `outputJar`: `RegularFileProperty`, the resolved game jar will be stored at the location provided by this property.
- `primaryGameJar`: `RegularFileProperty`, this is the primary location to look for the jar. If the jar does not exist at that location, only then it will try to find it through common steam installation directories. This property should be set to allow people to work with older versions of a game.
- `steamApplicationId` (**unused**): `Property<Integer>`, the appId of the game to fetch. Currently unsused, but might reserved for future use.
- `steamApplicationName`: `Property<String>`, the name of the steam application, or rather the name of the directory your game is located in relation to the "common" directory.
- `steamJarPath`: `Property<String>`, the path of game jar in relation to the game's directory on steam.

The default values of this task are for galimulator. For other games, readjust the properties to follow your game.

SML6 expects games to be bundled as a single jar. However, many games are likely to be bundled across multiple jars.
In that case, just create a merge request to SML6 to implement the desired functionality. I unfortunately
lack the resources to do the job for you (after all, I won't be modding the same game as you).
